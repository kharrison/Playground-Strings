# Swift String Cheat Sheet

 The Swift String API is [hard](https://www.mikeash.com/pyblog/friday-qa-2015-11-06-why-is-swifts-string-api-so-hard.html) to get used to. It has also changed over time as the Swift language and the standard library have developed. I first wrote this guide for Swift 2 and have since needed to update it for Swift 3, 4 and now Swift 5. So for my future reference and yours if you are struggling to make sense of it all here is my Swift String Cheat Sheet.

## Xcode Playground

You can get the latest version of the Xcode playground from my GitHub repository:
